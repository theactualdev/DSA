# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to my DSA repository! This is a collection of data structures and algorithms techniques that I have learned and am currently learning. The goal of this repository is to document my progress, practice problem-solving, and serve as a reference for future use.

## Contents

- **Data Structures**: Implementation and usage of various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash maps/tables/sets,  heaps, union find (disjoint set), tries and more.
- **Algorithms**: Exploration of sorting, searching, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, divide and conquer, and other algorithmic techniques.
- **Practice Problems**: Solutions to problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codeforces.

## Purpose

This repository is a personal learning tool to:
- Strengthen my understanding of DSA concepts.
- Improve my coding and problem-solving skills.
- Track my progress over time.

Feel free to explore and provide feedback!

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/theactualdev/dsa.git
